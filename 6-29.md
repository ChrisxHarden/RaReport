## TODO

## DONE
1. Finish understanding the code in tabular-training-objectives (deliverables: code summary in overleaf)
## DOING
1. Having a quick look at the Quantile normalization, understanding why using it and when to use it.
2. Collecting some more kaggle tabular datasets.


## Question:
1.  I think the main objective of me doing this is to have a better and more detailed understanding of Auto-ds. And in the mean time I can also extend the supported datasets of auto-ds into tabular datasets.
