# June 28th Report

## TODO
1. During collecting the Kaggle playground series dataset, I found that they were synthetically generated from some original datasets. I am going to collect those datasets as well.

## DONE
1. Finish the collection of kaggle datasets. 

## DOING
1. Reading codes from tabular-pretrain-objectives.



## Questions:
1. From reading the codes of tabular-pretrain-objectives and collecting the datasets, I found some problems of the datasets cannot be solved by the method they propose. For example some datasets' categorical features are in the format of strings and can have many values. Should I come up with solutions or just stick with their method?
   
2. I think it's better that the tabular datasets should also follow the style of the implemented datasets. But due to the difference between the tabular datasets and the already implemented datasets, should I create a subclass specially for the tabular datasets or just make the changes in each dataset file?
