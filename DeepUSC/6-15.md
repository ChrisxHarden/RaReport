# June-15th report

## TODO
1. Further understand code
2. finish 
## DONE
1. AutoCure
## DOING
1. Understand code
2. Reading Automatic Statistican (This is a book and Automatic Statistican is chapter 9 of it, do I need to read the rest?)

I think I made a mistake in first diving into the codes. I went through some codes but I can't connect them so I wasted a lot of time today in understanging the codes. I decide to first read the related papers, having a gist of what automatic dataset is doing, the concepts behind it and then read the codes.
