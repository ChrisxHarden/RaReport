## TODO
1. Further work on the first dataset and make it follows the style of the current datasets. But since tabular datasets don't need to perform feature extraction, and it won't be used to create sequential tasks, should I continue on doing this?

## Question:
1. All the tabular series data requires the user to click agree on the data webpage, making it not so automatic. Do we have anything to deal with it or we just ignore this.
