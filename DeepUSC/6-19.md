## TODO
1. When finish understanding of the code today, find related works
## DONE
1. give some summaries for prepherial components like feature extractors 
## DOING
1. Finish understanding code today, especially review the main.py code as I finished dataset.py
2. Finish Giving summaries and understanding of codes on overleaf. 


## Questions
1. I noticed for gpt2 feat extractor, we set the output to be on cpu while the others are not explicitly set to do so, why are we doing so?
2. why do we need both resnet and vit for image feature extraction?
3. Is our work part of AutoML?(Not an important question but I just want to know)
4. feats_name how do we specify this?
5. class 


## summary on codes
### dataset:
1. The actual implementation of dataset and the base set for autodataset and all the supported dataset.
2. support 3 actions, download, process, verify, can only be executed separetely
3. we use hashmap for the downloaded files
4. only if feature extractor not None, use memory-mapped dataset(I think that's we only map the features on memory, if it's metadata we won't map them on memory)
5. for the implemented datasets, we can verify whether they are downloaded, processed (exists corresponding pickle files), whether the features are loaded on the memory or not
6. The process of a dataset is to extract features and make metadata
7. All the features extracted will be first stored on cpu if we use make_features

### main:
