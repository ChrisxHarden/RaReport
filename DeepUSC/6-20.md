## TODO
1. Direction to look at: collections of benchmarking datasets.
## DONE
1. Finish code
2. articles found useful: 
   1.  synthbio(provide a curation method to improve human raters' processing speed to create synthetic biograph dataset)
   2.  PMLB can be useful as its a collection of datasets for benchmarking machine learning methods just like ours, and we have advantage against it.   
## DOING
1. Reading AutoML (Is this useful?)




## QUICK NOTES
1. Our methods advantage: 
   1. Multi-modality support, which means can be used in a wide range of machine learning tasks
   2. Provides preprocess, augmentation for supported datasets
   3. Provides download, verify besides preprocess, making the datasets desired can be ready-to-use easily.
   4. By projecting the dataset on feature space, we can improve the efficiency of reading datasets (smaller size and is memory mapped), help discover multi-modality capability of a model.
   5. Can produce a multi-task sequence with datasets specified by the user.
   6. Easy to extend
   7. Support multi-GPU process.
2. Maybe we can attach documentations of the datasets?
