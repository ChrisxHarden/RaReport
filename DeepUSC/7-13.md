### PhotoWCT2: Compact Autoencoder for Photorealistic Style Transfer Resulting from Blockwise Training and Skip Connections of High-Frequency Residuals
1. Method:First, we introduce blockwise training to perform coarse-to-fine feature transformations that enable state-of-art stylization strength in a single autoencoder in place of the inefficient cascade of four autoencoders used in PhotoWCT.Second, we introduce skip connections of high-frequency residuals in order to preserve image quality when applying the sequential coarseto-fine feature transformations. 
2. Fewer params
3.
