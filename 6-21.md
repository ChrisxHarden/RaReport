2. Automatic Data Acquisition for Deep Learning
## DOING
1. Responsible Data Integration: Next-generation Challenges
2. Moving drafts onto overleaf


-----------------------------
## Questions
1. A quick thought: In terms of using feature projection, maybe we can compare it against dataset distillation or coreset selection for memory cost reduction, training time consumption

### ACA V100M: Automatic Curation of Large-Scale Datasets for Audio-Visual Video Representation Learning
1. present an automatic dataset curation approach based on subset optimization where the objective is to maximize the mutual information between audio and visual channels in videos.
2. our approach finds videos with high audio-visual correspondence and show that self-supervised models trained on our data achieve competitive performances compared to models trained on existing manually curated datasets.
3.
